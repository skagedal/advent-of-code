# advent-of-code in typescript

This was boostrapped by the `oclif` tool. Unfortunately this brings in some annoying or [downright harmful](https://github.com/azat-io/eslint-plugin-perfectionist) eslint plugins. So far I've just been disabling them one by one, but I should probably learn eslint and set things up in a better way from the start.
